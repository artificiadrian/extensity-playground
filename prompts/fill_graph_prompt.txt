You are given a JSON document representing a graph that adheres to a predefined schema. Based on the input text and the provided extra information, your task is to:

    1. Identify relevant entities and relationships in the text that correspond to the node and edge types defined in the schema.
    2. Add new nodes and edges to the existing JSON document, ensuring that each new entry conforms to the schema's structure and properties.
    3. Update the JSON document with any additional properties or relationships that are implied or directly stated in the text.

<extra_info>{extra_info}</extra_info>
<graph>{graph}</graph>

Please expand the JSON document by adding the appropriate nodes and edges based on the input text. Make sure to adhere to the schema's structure and properties.
