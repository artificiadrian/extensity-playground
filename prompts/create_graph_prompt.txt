Please generate a JSON object that adheres to the GraphDefinition class structure. The graph should be defined according to my description down below.

    - Nodes should represent different types of entities relevant to the graph (e.g., "Person," "Location," "Event") and include appropriate properties (e.g., "name," "date," "importance").
    - Edges should represent relationships or connections between these entities (e.g., "interaction," "association," "causality"), with relevant properties (e.g., "strength," "duration," "type").

Ensure that the name, description, and properties fields are meaningful and tailored to the specified type of graph. Use appropriate value types (e.g., string, int, boolean, float) for properties.

Instead of multiple edge types between the same node, consider using enum properties to differentiate if applicable.

Generate the JSON object accordingly.
